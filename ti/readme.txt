Super Space Acer TI version was originally released in 1991. In 92, I believe, copies were distributed by Mediaware Florida. I have a bounty out for anyone who still has the original disk with label - and I'll accept a photo of it. ;)

Super Space Acer 2 was being worked on in 1995, but never got beyond the title sequence. Source code for it has been lost, so just the binaries (over in the dist folder).
