Working super folder for Super Space Acer. Most of the time you will just want the downloads which contain what executables exist.

Coleco - Current WIP version for the ColecoVision - lots of chickenscratch in here, not well organized.

DOS - an incomplete DOS port meant to run on my old arcade cabinet - psuedo 3d perspective port of the original TI version.

Jaguar - just some documents about an attempt to make a Jaguar version - nothing more than vapor.

TI - original TI port as well as the intro sequence for a never-completed sequel.
