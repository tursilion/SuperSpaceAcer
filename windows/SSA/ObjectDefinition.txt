[SSA OBJECT 1.0]
Must be the first instruction in any file

#include <file>
Includes the specified file as if it were part of this one

#define <name> <string>
Preprocesses each line of the file as it's read with the
requested substituion. No variables are allowed and the
expansion is only done once. ;)

UNITSPERMETER x;
The indicates the scale of the object, and is an integer 
between 1 and 10000. The scale of an object therefore
ranges from 2 meters to 20kms. Servers may adjust
undesired scales, so be warned.

SURFACE { } <name>;
Defines a surface type which will be used for texturing.
Allows the following commands:

	BASECOLOR (R,G,B);
	This keyword is mandatory.
	It is the flat shade color used under any textures,
	or if texturing is too expensive. RGB is expressed
	as 24-bit, each value 0-255 (0x00-0xff)

	BITMAP <picture.bmp>;
	Assigns a bitmap to this surface. The bitmap will
	be stretched onto the object. This keyword is optional.

	GLOSSINESS X;
	Specifies the glossiness of this object, used to
	merge in the environment map. The '%' is optional
	and the value is from 0-100. The default is 0.

PRIORITY x;
Specifies the priority of the following polygons. Priority
'0' specifies mandatory polygons and should be kept as low
as possible. Objects with too many mandatory polygons for
the system load will be displayed as blocks to prevent
degrading the other objects. The default priority is 0,
therefore use of this option is important. The maximum
priority is 253 (254 used for textures, and 255 used for 
environment mapping.) Internally the server will
maintain an estimation of overall load and render all objects
at the same detail level.

USE <surface>;
Specifies the surface definition to be used for all polygons
following. This option will parse across Priority levels
but it is recommended that it be re-specified for each
level defined for future compatibility.

TRIANGLE (x,y,z)-(x,y,z)-(x,y,z);
This defines one of the two primitives available - the triangle.
The triangle is added to the model based on the provided
co-ordinates. They are integer values with the origin representing
the center of the model. World co-ordinates for the model range
from -10000 to +10000 on all axis. Triangles should be defined
clockwise for hidden surface detection and texturing. 

STRIP (x,y,z)-(x,y,z)-(x,y,z)-(x,y,z)-(x,y,z);
This defines a triangle strip. The first two points must be defined
as if going clockwise around the first triangle, and the remainder
of the points in a zig-zag. Strips are a more effective way to
reproduce large rows of triangles. Otherwise they are handled the
same way.
