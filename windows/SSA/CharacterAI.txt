SSA AI State Engine

Personality traits tracked:
	Accuracy
	Focus (determination to stay on one target)
	Interest in primary goal (vs smaller targets)
	Randomness (how much other stats vary unpredictable)
	Respect for wingleader (doesn't matter who it is)
	Bravery (at what point do they pull out?)
	Team spirit (will they help others in trouble?)
	Ego (will they ask for help?)

Ships track the following stats:
	Frame (this is how it looks)
	Maneuverability (how quickly it responds to turns)
	Firepower
	Speed (uncertain due to railed nature of game)
	Shield strength
	Upgradeability (how much the powerups increase power)
	Weapon Accuracy (how much they drift)

	-Performance decreases with damage

States:
	No Status (flying on wing)
	Aquiring target (target identified)
	Pursuing target (with lock)
	Pursuing primary target
	Withdrawing

Always check stats with randomness factor when making determinations

No Status:
	If Wingleader requests assistance, check respect, acquire target
	If Team needs assistance, check team spirit, acquire target
	If a target is in view, check interest. If FAIL, acquire new target
	If primary target in view, check interest*2, acquire target

Acquiring Target:
	Check determination, if fail, check as for on wing
	If primary target in range and is not target in question, check interest, then
		acquire primary if pass
	Check for lockon, change to pursuing if pass

Pursuing target:
	Check determination, if fail, check for as on wing
	Check primary as in acquiring
	If target destroyed, return on-wing

Primary Target:
	Check interest and determination, if fail, check for other targets as on wing
	Check for assistance as in on wing, pass with determination as well

Withdrawing:
	No change, just trying to escape area

In all phases, check if being attacked. If rapid drop in shields, check ego and call for 
assistance, check bravery to see if it's time to withdraw.

If being attacked by player, warn player about friendly fire, then check respect and
determine whether to return fire
